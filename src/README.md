# What the heck is an Eludris

Eludris is a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
[federated](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)>),
[End-To-End-Encrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) Discord
x Reddit mesh-like social media platform where the priority is for it to be _truly
yours_.

To that extent Eludris aims to be as easily accessible by everyone, even if they
do not understand or care about the unique privacy-related features Eludris offers.

In terms of client Eludris is currently officially providing [Pilfer](https://github.com/eludris/pilfer)
(a lightweight TUI) and is working on a web based cross-platform web client.

However the intent has always been and still remains to be for people to make their
own clients, toolings, bots, API wrappers and so on.

As such Eludris has tried to convey said support via multiple things, namely the
[Eludris Community organisation](https://github.com/eludris-community) where people
can add their own creations and the [Eludris Awesome repository](https://github.com/eludris/awesome),
in addition to these docs.

For more info you can check out our [Official GitHub organisation](htt[s://github.com/eludris)
or our [website](https://eludris.pages.dev).

While you're also at it consider joining our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/amMHHjzwb9)
since that is currently mainly where we hang out, joke around and work on Eludris
and Eludris related stuff.

## Reading The Docs

The documentation is straight forward, however here are some additional clarifications
oh some of the points where you can get confused.

### Ommitabillity And Nullability

While reading the docs you might notice the use of the question marks next to field
names or types, here's an example of that.

| Field | Type    |
| ----- | ------- |
| Foo?  | Integer |
| Bar   | String? |

Now, you may be wondering what these question marks are going there, it depends
on where the question mark is, if the question mark is next to the field name like
in `Foo?`, then that field is ommitable, meaning that it is not guaranteed to exist,
however in a case where it exists it is **guaranteed** to be an Integer.

On the other hand if the question mark is next to the type like in `String?` it means
that while the field will always be present, its value can be a `null`.
