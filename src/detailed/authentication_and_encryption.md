# Authentication & Encryption
This page details how Authentication & Encryption may work for Eludris.

## The Token

Eludris uses JWT tokens to authenticate users. These tokens are required for nearly every interaction. Connection to the Gateway or trying to interact with the API? You'll need a token!
The JWT tokens used within our services use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random string with HC128 as a secret. 
If you wish to get a new token send an HTTP request to `/auth` with your email and password.

## End-To-End-Encryption

End-To-End-Encryption (we'll be calling it E2EE for now on) will be available to private communities, private GDMs (group direct messages) and direct messages (DMs) between friends.

### E2EE Implementation

To introduce this, every user has a personal, unique, public and private key provided.

Events with encrypted data (message, post, etc) have an extra field in their payload, the pubkey field which contains the public key the message's content was encrypted with so that the corresponding private key would be fetched from the user's public-private key pairs and requested if the current one is invalid.

As for storing public-private key pairs, storing them locally (on the client's machine) causes a lot of extra complexity, especially with sharing and syncing keys.

For example, issues with a client being offline when it's given a key, multiple clients and so on.

To combat that, Eludris' E2EE is designed so that each user has a super private-public key pair that their other private keys are encrypted with.

The instance *does not know* the user's super private key, additionally the instance gives the user all the (unencrypted) public and (ecnrypted with each user's super public key) private keys on connecting to Pandemonium, the instance ***never*** gets access to the non-encrypted private keys of *any* key pair at any point in time.

To further increase the security each instance marks all sessions (besides the first) as untrusted and essentially rats it out to everyone, a user can verify their session from their original session in which they securely pass on the super key pair to the new instance.

#### Direct Messages

This one is quite simple, upon a friend request getting accepted and two users becoming friends, the user who accepted the friend request sends a payload with a public key and a private key for the DM, both encrypted using the other user's public key.

After that all messages sent in this DM is encrypted using the DM's public key and are encrypted with their private key which is stored on the instance encrypted with the each user's super public-private key pair along with their other keys.

A user can also request they get a new key from the other end which will entirely scrap the old pair of keys and generate new ones in case the old ones get compromised.

#### Group DMs

Group DMs can be encrypted too, they work in a similar fashion, the host sends the room's public and private keys to all the starting participants on room creation encrypted with their public keys.

Any user can request they get the private and public keys of the room again in which any available user would just encrypt it using the request's user's public key and send it back. Upon a new user joining the GDM they could just request the room's keys.

The room's key's can also be re-generated by the GDM's host.

#### Private Communities

Private communities work similarly to how Group DMs work with the addition that the posts may also be encrypted but follow the same foundations.
